Closed-Loop Policy Inference and Evaluation
-------------------------------------------

This workflow demonstrates running the finetuned GR00T N1.7 policy in closed-loop and evaluating it
in the Arena Unitree G1 Static Apple-to-Plate Task environment using Arena's **server-client (remote-policy)
architecture**. The server hosts the finetuned checkpoint outside the Arena container; the Arena
container runs the simulation and queries the server over ZeroMQ.

Note that this tutorial assumes that you've completed the
:doc:`preceding step (Policy Training) <step_3_policy_training>`.


Step 1: Start the GR00T policy server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server runs GR00T's stock ``run_gr00t_server.py`` from the standalone Isaac-GR00T (N1.7) checkout.
Start it **before** launching the client; the client will connect on first inference. Run the
server **outside Docker** in the standalone Isaac-GR00T venv created in :doc:`index`.

The server takes all of its configuration from CLI flags (model checkpoint, embodiment tag, the
modality config from Arena's source tree, and bind host/port). Replace
``/path/to/IsaacLab-Arena`` with the absolute path to your Arena clone and ``${MODEL_PATH}`` with
the finetuned checkpoint directory from :doc:`step_3_policy_training`.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd $ISAAC_GR00T_DIR

   uv run python gr00t/eval/run_gr00t_server.py \
      --modality-config-path /path/to/IsaacLab-Arena/isaaclab_arena_gr00t/embodiments/g1/g1_sim_wbc_data_gr00t_n_1_7_config.py \
      --model-path ${MODEL_PATH} \
      --embodiment-tag NEW_EMBODIMENT \
      --device cuda \
      --host 0.0.0.0 \
      --port 5555

The server prints ``Server Ready and listening on 0.0.0.0:5555`` once it is ready for clients.


Step 2: Run Single Environment Evaluation (Arena container)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the server from Step 1 running, launch the Arena client. The client side does not need any
GR00T dependencies — it talks to the server over ZeroMQ — so it runs in the standard **Base**
Arena container. ``Gr00tRemoteClosedloopPolicy`` is Arena's client wrapper around the remote GR00T server.

**Docker Container**: Base (see :doc:`../../quickstart/installation` for more details)

:docker_run_default:

Once inside the container, set the dataset and models directories.

.. code:: bash

    export DATASET_DIR=/datasets/isaaclab_arena/static_apple_tutorial
    export MODELS_DIR=/models/isaaclab_arena/static_apple_tutorial

We first run the policy in a single environment with visualization via the GUI. Replace
``<SERVER_HOST>`` below with the IP of the host running Step 1 (or ``localhost`` if it is the
same machine).

.. caution::

   Before running, make sure the GR00T server from Step 1 was launched with the finetuned checkpoint
   directory you produced in :doc:`step_3_policy_training`.

.. code-block:: bash

   /isaac-sim/python.sh isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
      --viz kit \
      --policy_type isaaclab_arena_gr00t.policy.gr00t_remote_closedloop_policy.Gr00tRemoteClosedloopPolicy \
      --policy_config_yaml_path isaaclab_arena_gr00t/policy/config/g1_static_apple_gr00t_closedloop_config.yaml \
      --remote_host <SERVER_HOST> --remote_port 5555 \
      --num_steps 600 \
      --enable_cameras \
      galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place \
      --object apple_01_objaverse_robolab \
      --destination clay_plates_hot3d_robolab \
      --embodiment g1_wbc_agile_joint

Note the lower ``--num_steps`` (600 instead of 1500): with no walking phase, a successful
static apple-to-plate episode runs for roughly half as long as the loco-manipulation variant.

The evaluation should produce the following output on the console at the end of the evaluation.
You should see similar metrics.

Note that all these metrics are computed over the entire evaluation process, and are affected
by the quality of post-trained policy, the quality of the dataset, and number of steps in the evaluation.

.. code-block:: text

   [Rank 0/1] Metrics: {'success_rate': 1.0, 'object_moved_rate': 1.0, 'num_episodes': 1}


Run Parallel Environments Evaluation (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parallel evaluation of the policy in multiple parallel environments is also supported by the policy
runner. The command below assumes the server from Step 1 is still running.

Test the policy in 5 parallel environments with visualization via the GUI:

.. code-block:: bash

   /isaac-sim/python.sh isaaclab_arena/evaluation/policy_runner.py \
      --viz kit \
      --policy_type isaaclab_arena.policy.action_chunking_client.ActionChunkingClientSidePolicy \
      --remote_host <SERVER_HOST> \
      --remote_port 5555 \
      --num_steps 500 \
      --num_envs 5 \
      --enable_cameras \
      galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place \
      --object apple_01_objaverse_robolab \
      --destination clay_plates_hot3d_robolab \
      --embodiment g1_wbc_agile_joint

.. note::

   With the server-client architecture, the policy device is a server-side concern: the server
   places the policy on its own GPU via the ``--device`` flag passed to ``run_gr00t_server.py``
   in Step 1. The client's ``--device`` flag (above) controls Arena's physics backend, not the
   policy.

.. note::

   The parallel command uses ``ActionChunkingClientSidePolicy`` instead of
   ``Gr00tRemoteClosedloopPolicy`` (the single-environment client) because parallel evaluation
   needs the action-chunking buffer lifted out of the per-env policy and shared across envs.
   Single-env evaluation works with either client; the parallel command requires this one.

And during the evaluation, you should see the following output on the console at the end of the evaluation
indicating which environments are terminated (task-specific conditions like the apple is placed onto the plate,
or the episode length is exceeded by 30 seconds),
or truncated (if timeouts are enabled, like the maximum episode length is exceeded).

.. code-block:: text

   Resetting policy for terminated env_ids: tensor([3], device='cuda:0') and truncated env_ids: tensor([], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.int64)

At the end of the evaluation, you should see the following output on the console indicating the metrics.
You can see that the success rate might not be 1.0 as more trials are being evaluated and randomizations are being introduced,
and the number of episodes is more than the single environment evaluation because of the parallelization.

.. code-block:: text

   [Rank 0/1] Metrics: {'success_rate': 1.0, 'num_episodes': 4}

.. note::

   Note that the embodiment used in closed-loop policy inference is ``g1_wbc_agile_joint``, which is
   different from ``g1_wbc_agile_pink`` used during teleoperation recording.
   This is because during tele-operation, the upper body is controlled via target end-effector poses,
   which are realized by using the PINK IK controller, and the lower body is controlled via the AGILE
   WBC policy. The GR00T N1.7 policy is trained on upper body joint positions and lower body WBC
   policy inputs, so we use the joint-control twin (``g1_wbc_agile_joint``) for closed-loop policy
   inference -- it shares the AGILE lower-body backend with the recording embodiment, just bypasses
   PinkIK.

.. note::

   The single-environment command above does not pass ``--device``, so Arena defaults to its
   built-in physics backend. The parallel command explicitly sets ``--device cuda`` for
   throughput. If your dataset was recorded on GPU physics, prefer ``--device cuda`` for both
   single and parallel runs to keep evaluation physics aligned with training; if it was recorded
   on CPU physics, add ``--device cpu`` to the single-environment command for per-episode
   reproducibility (parallel throughput becomes the trade-off for CPU-trained policies).

.. note::

   The same-shelf placement makes the static variant slightly easier than the loco-manipulation
   apple-to-plate task: the destination plate is always within arm's reach so the policy
   never has to recover from a mistimed approach, and there are no intermediate locomotion
   phases that can drift off-course. The success criterion is the same contact-sensor
   termination used by the loco-manipulation variant (``force_threshold=0.5 N``,
   ``velocity_threshold=0.1 m/s``), filtered to contacts with the ``--destination`` asset.
   Both values are passed to ``PickAndPlaceTask`` from
   ``isaaclab_arena_environments/galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place_environment.py``; edit the
   ``force_threshold`` / ``velocity_threshold`` kwargs there if you need a different success
   criterion for a new pick-up object or destination.

.. note::

   **Common server-client failure modes.**

   - ``ValueError: Invalid action shape, expected: 23, received: 50.`` — the client's embodiment
     expects a 23-D PinkIK action, but the server is returning a 43-DoF joint chunk. Make sure the
     client uses ``--embodiment g1_wbc_agile_joint`` (joint twin), not
     ``g1_wbc_agile_pink`` (PinkIK twin).
   - ``ModuleNotFoundError`` on the client side — the client's ``--policy_type`` is wrong. The
     two valid client classes for this workflow are
     ``isaaclab_arena_gr00t.policy.gr00t_remote_closedloop_policy.Gr00tRemoteClosedloopPolicy``
     (single env, takes ``--policy_config_yaml_path``) and
     ``isaaclab_arena.policy.action_chunking_client.ActionChunkingClientSidePolicy`` (parallel,
     no YAML).
   - Action shape mismatch on the server (e.g., ``Action key 'left_arm''s horizon must be 40.
     Got 50``) — the action modality registered at training time disagrees with the modality
     loaded by the server. Re-finetune at the same horizon or update the
     ``--modality-config-path`` you pass to ``run_gr00t_server.py`` to match the checkpoint (see
     the caution in :doc:`step_3_policy_training`).
