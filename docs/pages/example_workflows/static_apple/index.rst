Unitree G1 Static Apple-to-Plate Task
=====================================

This example demonstrates the complete workflow for the **Unitree G1 static (no-locomotion) apple-to-plate task** in Isaac Lab - Arena, covering environment setup and validation, teleoperation data collection (OpenXR with Meta Quest 3 or Pico 4 Ultra), policy post-training directly on the recorded teleop demonstrations, and closed-loop evaluation.

The training step uses a **standalone clone of NVIDIA's Isaac-GR00T (N1.7) repository** rather than
the GR00T submodule pinned inside Arena, and evaluation runs over Arena's
**server-client (remote-policy) architecture**: the GR00T server hosts the finetuned checkpoint in
its own venv, and Arena's client runs the simulation in the standard Arena container and queries the
server over ZeroMQ. This decoupling means you can iterate on the model side without bumping Arena's
submodule or rebuilding the Arena container.

This workflow is the no-locomotion sibling of the :doc:`Unitree G1 Loco-Manipulation Box Pick and Place Task <../locomanipulation/index>`. The robot stands in place using the same Whole Body Controller (WBC) for balance, but the destination plate sits on the *same* shelf as the apple — within arm's reach — so the lower body never moves. If you want a tabletop manipulation surface for upper-body data collection without the complexity of full-body locomotion, this is the workflow to use.

Task Overview
-------------

**Task Name:** ``galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place``

**Task Description:** The Unitree G1 humanoid robot stands in front of a shelf and uses its arms to pick up
an apple and place it onto a plate sitting on the same shelf, within arm's reach. WBC actively
balances the standing pose (no locomotion, no squat), and PinkIK drives the upper body via the same
23-D action layout used by the loco-manipulation variant.

Workflow
--------

This tutorial covers the pipeline between creating an environment, collecting teleoperation
demonstrations, fine-tuning a policy (GR00T N1.7, from a standalone Isaac-GR00T checkout) directly
on the recorded HDF5, and evaluating the policy in closed-loop over Arena's server-client
architecture. Follow the steps in order from environment setup through closed-loop evaluation;
each step consumes the artifacts produced by the previous one.

.. note::

   This workflow trains directly from teleop recordings. The recorded HDF5 from
   :doc:`step_2_teleoperation` is converted to LeRobot format and
   fed straight into post-training in :doc:`step_3_policy_training`.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start the Isaac Lab Docker container:

:docker_run_default:

Create the folders for the data and models:

.. code:: bash

    export DATASET_DIR=/datasets/isaaclab_arena/static_apple_tutorial
    mkdir -p $DATASET_DIR
    export MODELS_DIR=/models/isaaclab_arena/static_apple_tutorial
    mkdir -p $MODELS_DIR

Standalone Isaac-GR00T (N1.7) checkout (used in :doc:`step_3_policy_training` and
:doc:`step_4_evaluation`):

.. code:: bash

    # Clone wherever you want; the docs below refer to it as $ISAAC_GR00T_DIR.
    # Pin to the commit this workflow was validated against.
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T.git /path/to/Isaac-GR00T
    export ISAAC_GR00T_DIR=/path/to/Isaac-GR00T
    cd $ISAAC_GR00T_DIR && git checkout 3df8b3825d67f755e69141446f4315f281b9b7e6

Open another terminal outside the Arena Base Docker container and set up the native GR00T
``uv`` environment from ``$ISAAC_GR00T_DIR`` by following the
`GR00T installation guide <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T#installation-guide>`_.

This venv is **separate** from Arena's container. Finetuning and the policy server both run from
this standalone checkout so you can pick up new GR00T releases (e.g. N1.7 → next) without rebuilding
Arena's container or bumping ``submodules/Isaac-GR00T``.
