Teleoperation Data Collection
-----------------------------

This workflow covers collecting demonstrations for the Unitree G1 static apple-to-plate task using **Meta Quest 3** or **Pico 4 Ultra** supported by `Nvidia IsaacTeleop <https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop>`_.

.. note::

   For supported IsaacTeleop hardware devices, see `Supported Input Devices
   <https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/overview/ecosystem.html#supported-input-devices>`_.
   Before starting teleoperation, also review the `IsaacTeleop system requirements
   <https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/references/requirements.html#teleoperation-with-isaac-sim-and-isaac-lab>`_.

.. admonition:: No teleoperation hardware?
   :class: tip

   The static task drops the locomotion / squat / turn channels but still needs bimanual end-effector
   control, so a keyboard or SpaceMouse is not practical. If you don't have an XR headset, you can
   still smoke-test the pipeline with the
   `Immersive Web Emulator Runtime (IWER)
   <https://github.com/meta-quest/immersive-web-emulator>`_. Open
   `<https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client>`_ in desktop Chrome (instead of the Quest browser);
   the page auto-loads IWER and emulates a Quest 3 with your mouse and keyboard, per the
   `IsaacTeleop Quick Start
   <https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/main/getting_started/quick_start.html>`_. Follow Steps 1--4
   below unchanged; the only difference is that Step 3 is done from a desktop browser tab. Because
   the static task is upper-body-only, IWER drives it noticeably better than the loco-manipulation
   variant — you can plausibly complete a few demos with just mouse + keyboard, though a real Quest
   3 still gives much smoother demonstrations.


Step 1: Start the CloudXR Runtime
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. On the host machine, configure the firewall to allow CloudXR traffic. The required ports depend on the client type. The example below uses ``ufw`` (Ubuntu); on other distributions use the equivalent firewall tooling (e.g. ``firewalld`` on Fedora/RHEL, ``pf`` on macOS).

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ufw allow 49100/tcp   # Signaling
      sudo ufw allow 47998/udp   # Media stream
      sudo ufw allow 48322/tcp   # Proxy (HTTPS mode only)


#. Start the CloudXR runtime from the Arena Docker container:

   :docker_run_default:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr

.. attention::

   The first run will prompt users to accept the NVIDIA CloudXR License Agreement.
   To accept the EULA, reply ``Yes`` when prompted with the below message:

   .. code:: bash

      NVIDIA CloudXR EULA must be accepted to run. View: https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/blob/main/deps/cloudxr/CLOUDXR_LICENSE

      Accept NVIDIA CloudXR EULA? [y/N]: Yes


Step 2: Start Arena Teleop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. In another terminal, start the Arena Docker container and launch the teleop session to verify the pipeline:

   :docker_run_default:

#. Run the following command to activate IsaacTeleop CloudXR environment settings:

   .. code-block:: bash

      source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

   .. important::
      **Order matters.** In the terminal where you will run Arena, ``source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` *after* the CloudXR runtime from Step 1 is already running,
      and *before* you start the Arena app. The Arena app must inherit the IsaacTeleop CloudXR environment variables.

#. Run the teleop script:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python isaaclab_arena/scripts/imitation_learning/teleop.py \
      --viz kit \
      --device cpu \
      galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place \
      --object apple_01_objaverse_robolab \
      --destination clay_plates_hot3d_robolab \
      --teleop_device openxr

#. In the running application, start the session from the **XR** tab in the application window.

Step 3: Connect from the headset device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For detailed instructions please refer to `Connect an XR Device <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/develop/source/how-to/cloudxr_teleoperation.html#start-cloudxr-runtime>`_:

A strong wireless connection is essential for a high-quality streaming experience. Refer to the `CloudXR Network Setup <https://docs.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk/latest/requirement/network_setup.html>`_ guide for router configuration.

#. Open the browser on your headset and navigate to `<https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client>`_.

#. Enter the IP address of your Isaac Lab host machine in the **Server IP** field.

#. Click the **Click https://<ip>:48322/ to accept cert** link that appears on the page.
   Accept the certificate in the new page that opens, then navigate back to the
   CloudXR.js client page.

#. Click **Connect** to begin teleoperation.

   .. note::
      Once you press **Connect** in the web browser, you should see the following control panel. Press **Play** to start teleoperation.
      You can also reset the scene by pressing the **Reset** button.

      If the control panel is not visible (for example, behind a solid wall in the simulated environment), you can put the headset on
      before clicking **Start XR** in the Isaac Lab Arena application, and drag the control panel to a better location.

         :width: 40%
         :alt: IsaacSim view
         :align: center

#. **Teleoperation Controls**:

   * **Left joystick**: Move the body forward/backward/left/right.
   * **Right joystick**: Squat (down), rotate torso (left/right).
   * **Controllers**: Move end-effector (EE) targets for the arms.


.. note::

   If the simulation runs at too low FPS and makes the teleoperation feel laggy, you can try to reduce the XR resolution from the XR tab / Advanced Settings / Render Resolution.

   .. figure:: ../../../images/xr_resolution.png
      :width: 40%
      :alt: XR resolution panel
      :align: center

      Reducing render resolution from 1 (default) to 0.2.

Step 4: Record with the headset device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   Run the following command to activate IsaacTeleop CloudXR environment settings again if you are starting the recording app from a different terminal.

   .. code-block:: bash

      source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

#. **Recording**: When ready to collect data, run the recording script from the Arena container:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export DATASET_DIR=/datasets/isaaclab_arena/static_apple_tutorial
      mkdir -p $DATASET_DIR

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Record demonstrations with OpenXR teleop
      python isaaclab_arena/scripts/imitation_learning/record_demos.py \
        --viz kit \
        --device cpu \
        --enable_cameras \
        --dataset_file $DATASET_DIR/arena_g1_static_apple_dataset_recorded.hdf5 \
        --num_demos 20 \
        --num_success_steps 10 \
        galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place \
        --object apple_01_objaverse_robolab \
        --destination clay_plates_hot3d_robolab \
        --teleop_device openxr

#. In the running application, start the session from the **XR** tab in the application window.

#. Follow Step 3 to connect the headset again.

#. Complete the task for each demo. After a successful placement, wait for the demo to
   automatically end and for the simulation to freeze before pressing **Reset**. Resetting
   early can save an incomplete or failed demonstration. The script saves successful runs
   to the HDF5 file above.

.. important::

   High-quality seed demonstrations are required because these recordings are converted directly to
   LeRobot format and used for policy post-training (see :doc:`step_3_policy_training`). The command
   above records ``--num_demos 10`` for a fast tutorial pass. For better inference results, change it
   to ``--num_demos 400`` and keep ``--num_success_steps 10`` so each successful episode includes
   extra stable frames after the success condition is triggered.

   Policy success rate depends heavily on both dataset quality and dataset size. For better success
   rates, collect more clean demonstrations with smooth actions, stable grasps, and no unnecessary
   collisions.

   Follow this protocol while collecting data:

   * **Warm-up:** complete about 5 practice runs before recording the main dataset so you
     are used to XR latency and the apple's contact behavior.
   * **Smoothness:** move consistently and avoid jerky motions. Jerky seed demonstrations lead to
     poor synthetic augmentations and unstable policy behavior.
   * **Body motion:** keep the robot torso and body fixed during this static task. Use only the arms
     and hands for manipulation.
   * **Grasp diversity:** include diverse grasp styles across the dataset, including top-down grasps
     and side grasps, so the policy does not overfit to one approach direction.
   * **Clean successes only:** save only runs with no unnecessary collisions, no dropped objects before
     placement, and no recovery motions that would confuse the policy.
   * **Wait for success freeze:** after releasing the apple onto the plate, keep the scene stable and
     wait until the recording auto-terminates/freezes. Only reset after that happens.
   * **Trajectory length:** aim for demonstrations around 200--400 timesteps. Very long episodes slow
     down downstream data processing, while very short episodes tend to contain abrupt motion.
   * **Replay validation:** after recording, replay the HDF5 with Step 5 and inspect camera frames,
     action smoothness, trajectory consistency, and overall task quality before training.

.. hint::

   Suggested sequence for good data collection:

   #. **Prepare the camera view:** first move the right arm to the side and keep it still, resting near the
      shelf/table surface if possible, to reduce visual clutter and self-occlusion.
   #. **Move to the apple:** approach the apple smoothly with the left arm, primarily along a horizontal
      path. A side approach is a good default trajectory for clean demonstrations.
   #. **Grasp execution:** once the hand is aligned with the apple, close the gripper/fingers firmly
      to establish a stable grasp.
   #. **Lift motion:** lift the apple straight upward before translating toward the plate. Avoid
      backtracking along the original approach path because it makes it harder for GR00T to distinguish
      approach and retreat motions during training.
   #. **Placement:** lower the apple until it is slightly above the plate surface, pause briefly in a
      stable pose, then release cleanly so the apple drops naturally onto the plate.

   Releasing a small round object onto a flat plate is noticeably harder than dropping a box into a
   bin. Keep the release height low and the orientation stable.

Step 5: Replay Recorded Demos (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replay the recorded HDF5 to sanity-check the saved action sequence. This doubles as a no-XR
check on the environment: it drives the env from the recorded actions and needs no teleoperation
device, so you can visually verify the scene, embodiment, and asset placements without launching
CloudXR.

.. note::

   ``replay_demos.py`` replays the captured **actions** in simulation; it is not exact trajectory
   or video playback. Because this is open-loop replay, small differences in contact dynamics,
   physics backend, timing, environment configuration, or the apple's randomized initial pose can
   make replay miss or drop the apple even when the original recorded demo succeeded. Treat replay
   as an action-level sanity check, and inspect the recorded camera data before recollecting data.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Replay from the recorded HDF5 dataset
   python isaaclab_arena/scripts/imitation_learning/replay_demos.py \
     --viz kit \
     --device cpu \
     --dataset_file $DATASET_DIR/arena_g1_static_apple_dataset_recorded.hdf5 \
     galileo_g1_static_pick_and_place \
     --object apple_01_objaverse_robolab \
     --destination clay_plates_hot3d_robolab
