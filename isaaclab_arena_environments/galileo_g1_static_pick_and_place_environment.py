"""Static-base G1 pick-and-place environment (WBC stands the robot in place; no nav).

This is a same-shelf-only variant of ``galileo_g1_locomanip_pick_and_place``: same
``galileo_locomanip`` background, same OpenXR retargeter, same 23-D action layout. The
default embodiment is ``g1_wbc_agile_pink`` (AGILE end-to-end velocity policy) instead of
``g1_wbc_pink`` (HOMIE stand+walk pair) -- the static task never walks, so the AGILE
single-policy backend is a better fit than HOMIE's stand/walk model split. The
``g1_wbc_pink`` embodiment is still accepted via ``--embodiment`` for users who want
HOMIE behaviour. The other differences from the locomanip env are:

1. The destination plate sits on the *same* shelf as the apple (within arm's reach), so
   the robot never needs to drive its base anywhere -- WBC just holds the standing pose.
2. The apple's spawn pose is randomized per episode within ``APPLE_SPAWN_XY_RANGE_M``
   (XY only) so recorded demos have spatial variation; the destination plate stays at a
   fixed pose so the place target is identical across episodes.
